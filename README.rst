FLEXI-TEER
==========

Welcome to the Felxi-TEER project. This project is about an adaptable, powerful open-source transepitheal electrical resistance device. This device will have wifi communication, generic electrode port (RJ45) and will be capable of both locked freq and impedence spectrocopy measurements. 

This is an open-source project and is actively looking for new contributers. Areas that are currently needing work in are:

1. Electrical design and testing current designs
2. Arduino coding
3. Housing and sample cell 3D designs

If you are interested in contributing to this project, please contact Michael Anderson at Michael.Anderson@childrens.harvard.edu with subject line FLEXI-TEER.
