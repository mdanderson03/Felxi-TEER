Welcome to the Felxi-TEER project. This project is about an adaptable, powerful open-source transepitheal electrical resistance device. This device will have wifi communication, generic electrode port (RJ45) and will be capable of both locked freq and impedence spectrocopy measurements. 

Currently this project is under development and the documentation is on the github wiki and here: [documentation](file:///C:/Users/mike/Documents/GitHub/Felxi-TEER/docs/_build/html/index.html)
