## Hardware Testing
All hardware has been breadboard tested, but further testing and characterization with multimeters and oscilloscopes are needed. 




## [.](Accessories.md){step}

We need the models below recreated in FreeCAD and a case for the electronics created. 

* TEER chamber that holds transwell in place as well as electrodes. Below is current model.
