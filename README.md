## What is Flexi-TEER

Flexi-TEER is an adaptable, powerful open-source transepitheal electrical resistance measurement device. Such tool is used by scientists who want to estimate the thickness of the layer of cells in a non-distructive way.

**T**rans**E**pithelial **E**lectrical **R**esistance (TEER) is an electrophysiology technique where resistance across a cell layer is measured as a proxy for ion flow which is related to inter-cellular tight junction formation.

## Where we are

At the moment the project is at the stage of hardware testing and software development. The testing status can be tracked in this document.
We recommend using OnlineOffice for the table of contents to work correctly.
