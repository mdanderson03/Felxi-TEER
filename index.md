#Flexi-TEER

![](images/logo.png)


Welcome to the Felxi-TEER project. This project is about an adaptable, powerful open-source transepitheal electrical resistance device. This device will have wifi communication, generic electrode port (RJ45) and will be capable of both locked freq and impedence spectrocopy measurements.

At this moment, we are looking for new people to contribute to this open source project. Please check the modules that need development page to see what areas you can contribute in.
